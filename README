These are a set of scripts I hacked up to simplify dealing with
p2 repositories.

To install:

  1. Copy the scripts somewhere handy.  I put mine in
     /usr/local/installs/p2-scripts.  Add this location to your
     PATH.

  2. Set P2HOME to the location.

  3. Set ECLIPSEHOME to the location of your Eclipse installation.

The scripts implicitly specify "-append" as appropriate: if you
want to overwrite a repository, then blow it away with "rm -rf"
first.

Caveats: p2-install-iu has far too many many options because
p2.director has far too many options.
